# General instructions
- Don't comment code

# Go projects
- Run go build to ensure the code can build
- Run go test if there are tests in the project
- For documentation about go libraries, use go doc
- Prefer separate lines for a function call that returns an error and the if err != nil check
- Do not use ioutil, it is deprecated
